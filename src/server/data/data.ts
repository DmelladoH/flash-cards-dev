    question: "In JavaScript, is everything an object?",
    answer: `
        <span>No</span>, The reason for this misconception is that most of the values in JS can behave as objects.
        <br/><br/>
        Boxing is a form of implicit coercion it happens when you are trying to use something that is not an object as an object, 
        like accessing the length property of a string. JS coerce that primitive into an object.

    question: "What is the DOM?",
    answer: `
        Is the Document Object Model. It represents the structure of a document as a tree of objects, where each object corresponds to a part of the document, such as elements, attributes, and text. 
        The DOM provides a way for programs to manipulate the structure, style, and content of web documents.
        When a web page is loaded, the browser creates a DOM representation of the HTML document. This representation is then used by scripts to interact with and manipulate the content of the page dynamically. For example, JavaScript can be used to change the text of an element, add new elements, or respond to user interactions like button clicks.
